Hi, I am Suzana, a second-year student in the Ph.D. program in computer science at the University of Tsukuba.

Now, let's go back in time for a second. In 2016, I graduated as a computer engineer at the Federal University of Amazonas. After that, I started to work as a software developer in [MÃ©liuz, an e-commerce company](https://www.meliuz.com.br/). My job tasks were related to search engines, crawlers, and optical character recognition. During that time, I learned a lot about machine learning and how we can use that to solve real-world problems.

In 2018, I was selected to study in Japan by the MEXT scholarship. I was a research student in my first year here, but I could extend the scholarship to the master's and doctoral programs. Since then, I've been developing my research under the supervision of [Prof. Kazuhiro Fukui](http://www.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kfukui/english/indexE.html) at the [Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab)](https://en.home.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/home) at the University of Tsukuba. My Ph.D. graduation is scheduled for March 2024.

My research interests include human action recognition, understanding sign languages, and change detection. Given my background, I am also interested in data mining, information retrieval, recommendation systems, and search engines.

Thank you for taking the time to read up about me, and please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any information.
