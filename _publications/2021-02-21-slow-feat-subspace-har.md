Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for change-point detection on behavioral data using slow feature subspaces. Traditionally, change detection methods divide a time series into past and present subsequences represented by subspaces using singular spectrum analysis (SSA). However, the degree of change between the past and present subspaces is calculated considering the minimal canonical angle, which can represent only abrupt changes. Besides, the subspaces are built using a naive approach, leading to poor performance. Inspired by these weaknesses, we propose a method that has three main contributions: 1) the use of slow feature subspaces, instead of the SSA-generated ones, to capture more sophisticated time structures, 2) the consideration of multiple canonical angles to detect abrupt and fine variation and 3) the construction of a normal model subspace to detect the changes more stably. Our results show that the proposed method is efficient and detects all the changes in the four behavioral datasets analyzed.
